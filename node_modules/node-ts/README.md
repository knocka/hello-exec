# node-ts [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/node-ts.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/node-ts) ![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/nikeee/node-ts.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/node-ts.svg)

This is a CommonJS module implemented using [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org) which allows you to connect to any TeamSpeakÂ® 3 server which has the Server Query API enabled. Using the Server Query API, you can do everything a normal TeamSpeak user can do (except sending and receiving voice data) automatically via JavaScript/TypeScript (e. g. listing clients logged in on the server).

The Server Query specification is available [here](http://media.teamspeak.com/ts3_literature/TeamSpeak%203%20Server%20Query%20Manual.pdf). I also created a script to import the complete query API from a TeamSpeak 3 server using the help command. This (json) dump will later be used to auto genrate some stuff. It is available as Gist [here](https://gist.github.com/nikeee/71e71439dd91999a3692).

This is a fork of [gwTumm's node-teamspeak](https://github.com/gwTumm/node-teamspeak) which has been ported from JS to TS.

## How to install
```bash
npm install node-ts # install package
```
If you are using TypeScript, you also have to install the definitions for `node`.
```bash
tsd install node --save
```
(you need [tsd](http://definitelytyped.org/tsd))

## Example Usage

After registering a Server Query account using your TeamSpeak Client, you can login using node-ts (Alternatively, you can login as the root account "`ServerAdmin`" which is created during the installation of the server). The following code prints out a JSON-array containing all clients that are currently connected to the first virtual server:

TypeScript sample:
```TypeScript
///<reference path="./node_modules/node-ts/build/node-ts.d.ts"/>
// or use "tsd link"

import {TeamSpeakClient} from "node-ts";

var cl = new TeamSpeakClient("##SERVER##"); // create a new client
try
{
	await cl.send("login", {
		client_login_name: "##USERNAME##",
		client_login_password: "##PASSWORD##"
	});
	await cl.send("use", { sid: 1 });
	const res = await cl.send("clientlist");
	console.dir(res);
}
catch(err)
{
	console.log("An error occurred:")
	console.dir(err);
}
```

## Usage information
-----------------

* TeamSpeakClient.send is the main method that executes a command. An array with options and an object with parameters can be passed to the send-function. The function returns a Q promise. See the TypeScript file for more information.
* Every TeamSpeakClient instance is an `EventEmitter`. You can install listeners to the "connect", "close" and the "error"-event. The error-event will only be fired if there was socket-error, not if a sent command failed.
* If you want to register to notifications sent by the TeamSpeak-Server, you can send a normal command `servernotifyregister` (consider specification). Any event sent by the server that starts with "`notify`" is then fired as an event (e. g. as soon as a `notifyclientmove` notification is sent by the server, the TeamSpeakClient-instance fires the "clientmove"-event with only one parameter which is an object containing the given parameters).
